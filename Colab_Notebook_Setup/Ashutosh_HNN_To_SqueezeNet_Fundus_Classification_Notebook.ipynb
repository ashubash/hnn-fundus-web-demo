        "We faithfully adapt the **Multi-Granularity Hypergraph Enhanced HNN** (Jiang et al., The Visual Computer 2024) as a Swin-Tiny teacher, replace explicit hypergraphs with native `nn.TransformerEncoder` for 2× speed and zero OOM, add **causal view alignment** + **hybrid diffusion conformal prediction**, distill into a **SqueezeNet-based student** with global self-attention propagation, and export to ONNX for mobile deployment.\n",

        "This pipeline performs **multi-class fundus image classification** for early ophthalmic disease detection, assigning retinal photographs to four classes: **Normal**, **Glaucoma** (optic cup enlargement, neuroretinal rim thinning), **Myopia** (peripapillary atrophy, tessellated fundus), and **Diabetes** (microaneurysms, dot-blot hemorrhages, hard exudates).\n",
        "\n",
        "Fundus images suffer from **extreme inter-class overlap** for e.g., perivascular sheathing in diabetes mimicking glaucomatous vessel bayoneting; myopic crescent overlapping with glaucomatous disc damage—while intra-class variance explodes due to acquisition artifacts (illumination, staining, cataracts). This creates ambiguous decision boundaries that pairwise graph models fail to capture.\n",
